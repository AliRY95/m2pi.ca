# Feasibility study for Vertical Axis Wind Turbines on highways, 

### Vakhtang Putkaradze, Senior Director, Science and Technology, ATCO

Among the renewable and clean energy technologies, wind energy is one of the
most efficient, costing 1â€“2 cents per kilowatt-hour after the production tax
credit by governments. While natural wind speeds over various continents in the
world span from 0 to 20 m/s, the Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWT) placed on
highway medians make it possible to utilize consistently higher wind speeds due
to vehicle motion. Additionally, the energy generated out of these wind turbines
is reported to increase multi-fold due to the shearing winds generated on both
sides of the medians by the on-going traffic [3]. Your task will be to optimize
the positioning of turbines to achieve optimal results using criteria you deem
to be important, such as output power, ease of installation/repair, proximity to
consumers, additive effects from positioning, etc, using real-life traffic,
geographical and weather data, and subsequently investigate economic feasibility
of implementation of this technology.
