summary: "The goal of this project is to develop a housing price
estimate/forecast using publicly available data to inform evidence-based
decision making for the benefit of government regulators, industry
practitioners, and concerned citizens.  

Students will be expected to use Python 3.X for data acquisition, cleaning,
organization, and manipulation.  Working experience with libraries such as
Pandas may be useful.  Previous experience with other programming languages such
as Matlab or R is useful but not required."
