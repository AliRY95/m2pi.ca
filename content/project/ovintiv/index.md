# Practical Option Valuation with Negative Underlying Prices

### Industry Mentor: Scott Dalton, Director of Risk Management, Ovintiv

In March 2020, the WTI futures contract settled below zero for the first time in the contract's history.  Many market participants apply the Black 76 model or a variation of this model to calculate the value of the options on this futures contract.  However, Black 76 requires positive underlying market prices.  The goal of this project is to identify alternative models which can accept negative underlying pricing, and assess the suitability of the alternatives.

People interested in quantitative finance, commodity training and marketing, and bridging the gap between quantitative experts and non-experts would be excellent team members for this project.
