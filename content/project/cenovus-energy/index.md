title: "Cenovus Energy"
summary: "This project concerns the transportation of heavy oil via pipeline,
and the impact of congestion in transportation on pricing.  Using stochastic
transport optimization can we model and answer the following questions: When
there are documented disruptions in the transport system, can we predict how
large the congestion surcharge was and how prices responded to the disruption?
Can we predict the occurrence of congestion by perturbing input factors in the
system? How do shape and connections in the transport network contribute to the
propensity for frequency of the congestion and magnitude of congestion
surcharge?"

# Modelling Canadian Heavy Crude Congestion pricing using Capacitated Transport networks

## Industry Mentor: Nima Safaian, Market Analytics Head, Cenovus Energy

This project concerns the transportation of heavy oil via pipeline, and the impact of congestion in transportation on pricing.  Using stochastic transport optimization can we model and answer the following questions:
* When there are documented disruptions in the transport system, can we predict how large the congestion surcharge was and how prices responded to the disruption?
* Can we predict the occurrence of congestion by perturbing input factors in the system?
* How do shape and connections in the transport network contribute to the propensity for frequency of the congestion and magnitude of congestion surcharge?
