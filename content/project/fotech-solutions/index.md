# Traffic monitoring with distributed acoustic sensing

### Industry Mentor: Matt McDonald, Chief Technology Officer, Fotech Solutions


Consider a distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) system monitoring a fibre optic cable deployed along an active roadway. The goal of this project is to use data collected from the DAS system to develop a detection and tracking method capable of identifying individual vehicles and reporting their position and velocity as they move along the road/fibre.  Once the position and velocity are determined, various metrics for traffic flow could be determined, allowing for prediction and optimization of traffic congestion.

Keywords: digital signal and image processing, wave equations, sensor arrays, big data, machine learning.
