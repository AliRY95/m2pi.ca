title: "Divi Project"
summary: "The main limitation of blockchains is storage requirements, which
would be alleviated if one could reversibly compress the data in a blockchain or
in its underlying transaction graph. Determine to what extent a transaction
graph can be compressed (for later decompression) or what obstructions exist to
its compression. What compression ratio can you achieve for an ordered sequence
of cryptographic hashes? Pure Mathematics skills and experience with
mathematical proof-writing are essential skills for this project.  Knowledge of
undergraduate-level cryptography or Python programming skills would be assets,
but are not required."

# Compressibility of the transaction graph for the proof-of-protocol in a blockchain

### German Luna Patiarroy, Lead Blockchain Developer, The Divi Project

The main limitation of blockchains is storage requirements, which would be alleviated if one could reversibly compress the data in a blockchain or in its underlying transaction graph.
* Determine to what extent a transaction graph can be compressed (for later decompression) or what obstructions exist to its compression.
* What compression ratio can you achieve for an ordered sequence of cryptographic hashes?

Pure Mathematics skills and experience with mathematical proof-writing are essential skills for this project.  Knowledge of undergraduate-level cryptography or Python programming skills would be assets, but are not required.
