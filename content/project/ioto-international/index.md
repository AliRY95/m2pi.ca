# The Goverlytics Problem

### Industry Mentor: William Spat, CEO and Founder, Ioto International

Performance metrics in sports have seen remarkable growth and development.  What if we turned some of these mathematical tools on political performance?  The goal of this project is to analyze data which are related to the progression of a bill into law in the US.

A background in statistics or graph theory would be helpful.  Some background in computer programming or data science may be helpful, but not necessary.
