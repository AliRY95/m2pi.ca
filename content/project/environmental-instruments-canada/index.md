# Thoron testing

### Industry Mentor: Kai Kaletsch, President, Environmental Instruments Canada

Environmental Instruments Canada (EIC) produces a Radon Sniffer which is used to find radon entry points.  One method of determining the ratio of Radon 222 to Radon 220 (thoron) in the air is by implementing sampling and counting sequences and observing the change in the alpha count over time.  The goal of this project is to develop an optimized sampling and counting sequence that results in the best statistical accuracy.

Understanding radioactive decay and the coupled differential equations describing a decay series would be useful.  A team with statistical expertise would be essential.  Some familiarity with spreadsheets such as Excel would be helpful.
