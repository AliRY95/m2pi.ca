title: "Aerium Analytics"
summary: "Standard procedure for building training sets for some machine
learning models involves an individual going through hundreds of images and
creating 2D binary matrices which reflects where the region of interest is in
each image. Depending on the type of images, can we use RGB information or some
other method to automate this process?  The goal of this project is to develop a
method which creates a mask of an image depicting where monochromatic objects
occur in an image automatically and with limited user input."

#  Automated region of interest creation for training sets

Standard procedure for building training sets for some machine learning models involves an individual going through hundreds of images and creating 2D binary matrices which reflects where the region of interest is in each image. Depending on the type of images, can we use RGB information or some other method to automate this process?  The goal of this project is to develop a method which creates a mask of an image depicting where monochromatic objects occur in an image automatically and with limited user input.
