I am currently a PIMS Postdoctoral Fellow at the Mathematics Department at the
University of Manitoba, where I work with Raphaël Clouâtre in operator theory. I
started my academic career in Physics at the University of Dayton. After
graduating I pursued a PhD in Physics at Indiana University, studying topics in
constructive field theory with John Challifour, before switching to the
Mathematics Department, where I studied operator theory under the guidance of
Hari Bercovici. I graduated with a PhD in Pure Mathematics from Indiana
University in 2017, and then started my current position at the University of
Manitoba.
