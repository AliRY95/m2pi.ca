I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and
Statistics at the University of Saskatchewan.

Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in Combinatorics and Optimization at the
University of Waterloo, under the supervision of Levent Tun√ßel. After that, I
was an Assistant Professor at the Milwaukee School of Engineering for several
years.

### Research

My research interests mainly lie in discrete optimization. In particular, I like
to study the theory and applications of linear, integer and semidefinite
programming, and problems in closely related areas such as graph theory and
approximation algorithms. Currently, I'm focused on analyzing lift-and-project
methods, and their power and limitations in tackling problems that arise from
combinatorial optimization.

I have also worked on several problems in combinatorics, and am easily attracted
by most things discrete mathematics in general.
