# The Opportunity
Math<sup>Industry</sup> (Math to power industry) is a professional development
school positioned to benefit Canadian industry because:

1. Recent PhDs and Postdocs in the mathematical sciences are a national resource
   that is poised to be underutilized.
2. Ideas from the mathematical sciences are vital to Canada’s industry sectors
   and are especially important during and after the pandemic.
3. A cohort-based training and job placement program focused on key industry
   sectors will help advance Canada’s economy.

The drastic decrease in economic activity caused by the pandemic combined with
cost explosions in other governmental programs will lead to significant cuts in
higher education budgets. Reductions in the capacity of universities to hire new
faculty and postdocs will essentially eliminate a career pathway for a
generation of young researchers. This talent pool should be effectively
redirected toward activities that drive Canada’s economic recovery.
